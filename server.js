** This is the server. For it to work, follow these instructions:
** See the example.json file in the project folder? Inside of it are instructions on how to make our program work.
** Those are needed because you need an API-Key to use the program. We can't let you see our API-Keys so we need you to use your own.
** Just put it in th example.json file following the instructions, and then make sure you reference the path to this file in the "ApiKey" variable lower in the file.
